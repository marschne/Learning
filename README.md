MAC / VS Learning Project

Regarding to:
https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Visual-Studio-2022-for-MAC---Intellisens/10307271

what is not working:
Intellisense for CSS and jquery.

I'm currently working on another (real) project for a customer (.net 6 MVC) and here no Intellisense too!
I'm looking forward for a solution and appreciate any help!
Currently I'm updating VS MAC to V17.5.2.14.

On Visual Studio for Win everything works fine!

Kind regards
Martin Schneider
